Classes as objects
------------------

Classes include the keys of an object
so that you can call methods on them.

When you do this, think of it as an object.
Otherwise you will confuse:

* the class key
* superclass key
* the singleton class
* the class `Class`

To avoid the confusion, keep the responsibilities
separate in your mind:

* Linked list of methods, its a class
* Looking up constants, its a class
* Calling methods, its an object
* Looking up ivars, its an object
