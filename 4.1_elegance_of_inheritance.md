Elegance of Inheritance
-----------------------

The structure of a linked list:

* Base: `{head: some node}`
* Node: `{data: ..., link: some node}`

The structure of an object and class:

* Object: `{class: some class}`
* Class:  `{methods: ..., superclass: some class}`

So:

* Objects are the base of a linked list
* Their class is the head of the list
* Each class is a node in the list
* Their methods are their data
* Their superclass is the link to the next node
