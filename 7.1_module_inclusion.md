Module Inclusion
----------------

* Q: How classes share methods when they have different
     inheritance hierarchies?
* A: Insert another class at the class's superclass.
     Point its methods key at another class's methods.

This is module inclusion.

Here is an [Image](https://github.com/JoshCheek/object-model-hash-style/blob/master/modules_diagram.jpg)
to make it more visual.


```ruby
require 'objspace'

public def actual_superclass
  ObjectSpace.reachable_objects_from(self).last
end

A = Module.new

# The included class is inserted at D's superclass
class D
  actual_superclass    # => Object
  include A
  actual_superclass    # => #<InternalObject:0x007fd47096d880 T_ICLASS>
    .actual_superclass # => Object
end
```


Here is a hypothetical implementation of include

```ruby
def hypothetical_include(klass, mod)
  new_super            = Class.new
  new_super.methods    = mod.methods
  new_super.superclass = klass.superclass
  klass.superclass     = new_super
  klass
end
```

The method lookup algorithm
will then allow it to find the methods in the module.
