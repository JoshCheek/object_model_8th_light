* Q: Who is this for?
* A: Intermediate to advanced Ruby devs.

* Q: What is the topic?
* A: How Ruby works.

* Q: What's required of a programming language?
* A: Data with a way to manipulate it.
     In other words: nouns and verbs.

* Q: What is Ruby?
* A: A bunch of ideas, not MRI, or some version

* Q: Are these things really hashes?
* A: Doesn't matter, hashes keep it concrete,
     anything that lets you give names to values works,
     MRI uses a C struct when the keys don't change.
     If implementing in Ruby, you could use objects
     with `attr_accessor`
