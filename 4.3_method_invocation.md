Method Invocation
-----------------

```ruby
expr1.method_name(expr2, expr3)
```

* Evaluate `expr1` to find the receiver
* Evaluate `expr2` and `expr3` to find the args
* Lookup the method:
  * On the receiver, go to the class
  * look in the superclass
  * until you find the method
* Push the binding onto the callstack
  * Set `self` to the receiver
  * Set the arguments to local vars
  * Set the instruction to the method body
* Run the code
* Pop the binding from the callstack
* Set the current return value
  to the binding's return valaue
